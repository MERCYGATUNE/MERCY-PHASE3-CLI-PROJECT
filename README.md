## Generating Your Pipenv

You might have noticed in the file structure- there's already a Pipfile! That
being said, we haven't put much in there- just Python version 3.8 and ipdb.

Install any dependencies you know you'll need for your project, like SQLAlchemy
and Alembic, before you begin. You can do this straight from the command line:

```console
$ pipenv install sqlalchemy alembic
```

From here, you should run your second commit:

```console
$ git add Pipfile Pipfile.lock
$ git commit -m'add sqlalchemy and alembic to pipenv'
$ git push
```

Now that your environment is set up, run `pipenv shell` to enter it.
